`devoutaudio` is an audio output "graphics" device - instead of rendering pixels, 
each graphics primitive is rendered as an audio snippet.

This is a testing ground for some graphics-to-sound ideas and is **very** experimental.

`devoutaudio` is written in plain R, and uses the 
[devout](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/devout) package to interface with the
R internals

### Point-to-sound mapping

* x position is mapped to audio channel position - points on the left of the plot
  are rendered mainly in the left channel of audio
* y position is mapped to frequency - the higher the point the higher the frequency
* size is mapped to duration - larger points have a longer sound


## Installation

You can install `devoutaudio` from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/devoutaudio) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/devout")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/devoutaudio")
```


## Caveats

* This is a very experimental device.
* Only circles are currently mapped to a sound
* Audio is only played on-the-fly and there is no facility to save yet.


## Ideas

* currently just using `audio` package to generate some beeps, but there are 
  other more complex sound synthesis packages in R e.g. `seewave`, `soundgen`, 
  `tuneR`, `phonTools`
* Horizontal lines are sounds that move across the stereo landscape
* Vertical lines are a note of rising pitch
* Map line thickness to volume
* Text rendering = text-to-speech. Or generated phonemes with something like {soundgen}


# Examples

In the following examples:

* only audio is produced by the code show, but I've included the visual representation
  of the plots to assist in interpreting the audio
* because the audio is never saved to file, the audio was captured on-the-fly 
  from the MacOS sound output device

## Example 1


```{r example1, eval=FALSE}
library(devoutaudio)

audio()
plot(1:10)
dev.off()
```


### [Click to play audio rendering](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/devoutaudio/blob/master/man/figures/mp3/audio1.mp3?raw=true)

```{r graph1, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```




## Example 2


```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
plot_df <- mtcars %>% arrange(mpg)

audio()
ggplot(plot_df) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, wt, size = cyl)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
dev.off()
```

### [Click to play audio rendering](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/devoutaudio/blob/master/man/figures/mp3/audio2.mp3?raw=true)

```{r graph2, echo = FALSE}
plot_df <- mtcars %>% arrange(mpg)

ggplot(plot_df) +
  geom_point(aes(mpg, wt, size = cyl)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
